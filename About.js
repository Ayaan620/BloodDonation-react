      <h2>About Blood Donation</h2>
      <p>
        Blood donation is a simple act that can save lives. Every donation can help up to three different people.
        We organize this camp to encourage people from all over the city to donate blood and help those in need.
      </p>
      <p>
        Join us in this noble cause and help make the world a better place.
